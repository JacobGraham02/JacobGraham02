##Hello! I am @JacobGraham02. I am a fourth-year BSc. Honours Computer Science student getting my Computer Science degree from Lakehead University.I am primarily interested in building applications which combine many useful services together, such as ##my DiscordStudentHelper bot which combines Discord, Mongodb, and Google Maps to assist students in their studies. 

##The technologies I use daily and am most familiar with include Java, JavaScript, Php, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I use Docker, Laravel, MySQL, and MongoDB.
##I am currently studying to obtain my CCNA 

##A list of projects that I am currently working on include the following:
###1. ScumChatMonitor (finished): An in-game bot integration which grants users extra in-game functionality to augment their experience and completely remove the need for any third-party software
###2. DiscordStudentHelper: A Discord bot which integrates with MongoDB and Google Maps to assist students in their studies
###3. FormToDoc: A script which, when attached to a Google Form document, fetches all of the answers from the Google Form and writes them into a document
###4. Blogger: A personal blogging site primarily aimed at allowing me and any future users to elaborate on any projects they have completed in-detail
